1. The result of the code is:
   ```
   1 2 8
   ```
   Explanation: The `func()` function is defined with three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, with default values of 6 and 8 assigned to `b` and `c`, respectively. When `func(1, 2)` is called, the value 1 is assigned to `a` and 2 is assigned to `b`. Since no value is provided for `c`, it takes the default value of 8. Therefore, when `print(a, b, c)` is executed inside the function, it prints `1 2 8`.

2. The result of the code is:
   ```
   1 2 3
   ```
   Explanation: The `func()` function is defined with three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, with a default value of 5 assigned to `c`. When `func(1, c=3, b=2)` is called, the value 1 is assigned to `a`, 3 is assigned to `c` (by using keyword argument `c=3`), and 2 is assigned to `b` (by using keyword argument `b=2`). Therefore, when `print(a, b, c)` is executed inside the function, it prints `1 2 3`.

3. The result of the code is:
   ```
   1 (2, 3)
   ```
   Explanation: The `func()` function is defined with a parameter `a` and `*pargs` as a variable-length argument parameter. When `func(1, 2, 3)` is called, the value 1 is assigned to `a`, and the remaining arguments 2 and 3 are packed into `pargs` as a tuple. Therefore, when `print(a, pargs)` is executed inside the function, it prints `1 (2, 3)`.

4. The result of the code is:
   ```
   1 {'c': 3, 'b': 2}
   ```
   Explanation: The `func()` function is defined with a parameter `a` and `**kargs` as a keyword argument parameter. When `func(a=1, c=3, b=2)` is called, the value 1 is assigned to `a`, and the keyword arguments `c=3` and `b=2` are packed into `kargs` as a dictionary. Therefore, when `print(a, kargs)` is executed inside the function, it prints `1 {'c': 3, 'b': 2}`.

5. The code prints:
   ```
   1 5 6 5
   ```
   Explanation: The `func()` function is defined with four parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. When `func(1, *(5, 6))` is called, the value 1 is assigned to `a`, and the tuple `(5, 6)` is unpacked and assigned to `b` and `c`, respectively. Since no value is provided for `d`, it takes the default value of 5. Therefore, when `print(a, b, c, d)` is executed inside the function, it prints `1 5 6 5`.

6. The result of the code is:
   ```
   1 [&#39;x&#39;] {'a': 'y'}
   ```
   Explanation: The `func()` function is defined with three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`. Inside the function, `a` is assigned the value 2, `b[0

]` is modified to `'x'`, and `c['a']` is modified to `'y'`. When `l=1`, `m=[1]`, and `n={'a':0}` are passed as arguments to `func(l, m, n)`, the value of `l` is not modified because it is immutable. However, the list `m` and dictionary `n` are mutable, so their values are modified inside the function. Therefore, after the function call, `l` remains 1, `m` becomes `['x']`, and `n` becomes `{'a': 'y'}`.
