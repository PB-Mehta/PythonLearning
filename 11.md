1. ```
assert spam >= 0, "spam cannot be a negative integer"
```

2. ```
assert eggs.lower() != bacon.lower(), "eggs and bacon cannot be the same (case-insensitive)"
```

3. ```
assert False, "This assert statement always triggers an AssertionError"
```

4. The two lines that must be present in your software to call `logging.debug()` are:
```
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

5. The two lines that your program must have to make `logging.debug()` send a logging message to a file named `programLog.txt` are:
```
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='programLog.txt', level=logging.DEBUG)
```

6. The five levels of logging, in increasing order of severity, are:
   - DEBUG: Detailed information, typically used for debugging purposes.
   - INFO: General information about the program's execution.
   - WARNING: Indicates a potential issue or something that might cause problems later.
   - ERROR: Indicates a more serious problem or error in the program.
   - CRITICAL: Indicates a critical error that may prevent the program from running correctly.

7. To disable all logging messages, you can add the following line of code:
```
logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)
```

8. Using logging messages is better than using `print()` for several reasons:
   - Logging messages can be easily enabled or disabled based on the configured logging level, allowing for fine-grained control over the verbosity of the program's output.
   - Logging messages can be written to various outputs, such as the console, files, or network streams, making it flexible to capture and analyze the program's behavior.
   - Logging messages can include additional information like timestamps, log levels, and source code line numbers, which can be valuable for debugging and troubleshooting.
   - Logging messages can be categorized into different levels, making it easier to filter and prioritize messages based on their importance.

9. The differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger are as follows:
   - Step Over: Executes the current line of code and moves to the next line in the current function. If the current line contains a function call, it executes the entire function without stepping into it.
   - Step In: If the current line of code contains a function call, it steps into that function and moves to the first line of that function's definition, allowing you to debug the function line by line.
   - Step Out: Steps out of the current function and continues execution until it returns to the calling function. It is useful when you want to quickly move out of a function and continue debugging at the caller's location.

10. After clicking Continue, the debugger will stop when it encounters the next breakpoint, an unhandled exception, or when the program execution is completed.

11. A breakpoint is a designated point in the source code where the debugger pauses the program's execution, allowing you to inspect the program's state and variables at that particular moment. It helps in debugging by allowing you to control the program's flow and examine the values of variables to identify and fix issues.
