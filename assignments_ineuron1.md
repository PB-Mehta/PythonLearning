1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*                    (expression)
'hello';             (Value)
-87.8                (Value)
-                    (expression)
/                    (expression)
+                    (expression)
6                    (Value)


2. What is the difference between string and variable?
_ANS._ Variables are used to store information in them whereas strings are the type of data where operations can be done for example in EDA and feature engineering

3. Describe three different data types.
_ANS._ 1.Numeric Type - Integer,float,complex number
       2.Sequence Type - strings,list,tuple
       3.Boolean - Returns True or False 


4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
_ANS._ expression consist of operand and operator . operators such as + - * / and operands are entities between which operations are to be done . expression do the task of assigning the values for example assigning value of right operand to left operand


5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
_ANS._ in spam = 10 address is allocated to value 10 in variable name spam , this interpretation is done by the interpreter in python so expression produces the output and statements does not they are simply used for declation type of tasks 


6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
_ANS._
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
print(bacon)
output - 22 & 
bacon = 22
print(bacon + 1)
output - 23


7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
_ANS._ both the case will produce spamspamspam


8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
_ANS._ variable name cannot be started with numeric 

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
_ANS._ int() for integer float() for floting point number and str() for string


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
I have eaten  + 99 + burritos.
_ANS._  It produced error because I have eaten  + 99 + burritos is not a value sp no operations can be done 
print('I have eaten'  + ' 99 ' + 'burritos')
