1. No, the Python Standard Library is not included with PyInputPlus. PyInputPlus is a separate third-party library that provides additional functionality for user input validation and retrieval.

2. PyInputPlus is commonly imported with the alias `pypi` to provide a shorter and more convenient name when using the library's functions. This alias allows for a more compact and readable code when working with PyInputPlus.

3. `inputInt()` is used to prompt the user for input and ensures that the input is a valid integer value. If the user enters a non-integer value, it will prompt again until a valid integer is provided. On the other hand, `inputFloat()` is used for input validation of floating-point numbers. It ensures that the user enters a valid floating-point number and re-prompts if an invalid value is provided.

4. To ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99 using PyInputPlus, you can use the `inputInt()` function with the `min` and `max` keyword arguments. Here's an example:
   ```python
   number = pyip.inputInt(prompt='Enter a number: ', min=0, max=99)
   ```

5. The `allowRegexes` and `blockRegexes` keyword arguments in PyInputPlus allow you to specify regular expressions as patterns for allowable or blocked input. `allowRegexes` accepts a list of regular expressions, and if any of the patterns match the input, it is considered valid. Conversely, `blockRegexes` accepts a list of regular expressions, and if any of the patterns match the input, it is considered invalid.

6. If a blank input is entered three times using `inputStr(limit=3)`, it will raise a `pyinputplus.RetryLimitException` with an error message indicating that the maximum number of retries has been reached.

7. If a blank input is entered three times using `inputStr(limit=3, default='hello')`, it will return the default value `'hello'` instead of raising an exception. The `default` keyword argument specifies the value to be returned if the user does not provide valid input within the specified limit.
