Q1. A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes or events occurring in a specific set of circumstances. It provides a way to assign probabilities to possible outcomes, indicating the relative likelihood of each outcome. While the individual values within a probability distribution are random, the distribution itself follows a specific pattern or behavior based on the underlying probabilities. This allows us to make predictions about the likelihood of certain outcomes or analyze the overall behavior of the random variable.

Q2. Yes, there is a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers. True random numbers are generated from natural processes that are inherently unpredictable, such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay. They are considered truly random as they cannot be determined or predicted with certainty. Pseudo-random numbers, on the other hand, are generated by deterministic algorithms that produce a sequence of numbers that appear random but are actually determined by an initial value called the seed.

Pseudo-random numbers are considered "good enough" for many applications because they exhibit statistical properties similar to true random numbers. While they are deterministically generated, they pass various statistical tests for randomness and exhibit properties like uniformity and independence. For most practical purposes, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers is sufficiently random and can be used effectively in simulations, cryptography, and other applications.

Q3. The two main factors that influence the behavior of a "normal" probability distribution are the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean represents the central tendency of the distribution and indicates where the peak or center of the distribution is located. The standard deviation measures the spread or variability of the values around the mean. A larger standard deviation indicates greater dispersion or variability, while a smaller standard deviation indicates a more concentrated distribution.

Q4. A real-life example of a normal distribution is the distribution of heights of adult males. In a large population, heights tend to follow a roughly normal distribution, with most individuals clustered around the average height and fewer individuals at the extremes (very tall or very short). The mean height represents the average height of the population, and the standard deviation represents the typical range of heights around the mean.

Q5. In the short term, the behavior of a probability distribution can be unpredictable due to the random nature of individual outcomes. However, as the number of trials or observations increases, the distribution tends to exhibit its expected behavior more accurately. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that with a large enough sample size, the observed frequencies of outcomes will converge to their expected probabilities. In other words, the more trials you conduct, the closer the distribution will resemble its theoretical properties.

Q6. The `random.shuffle` function in Python can shuffle sequences or lists. It takes a sequence as an argument and randomly reorders its elements. The sequence can be a list, tuple, or any other iterable object. The function modifies the original sequence in place, changing the order of its elements. Each possible arrangement of the elements has an equal probability of occurrence.

Q7. The `math` package in Python provides several general categories of functions:

- Basic arithmetic functions: These include functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (`math.add`, `math.subtract`, `math.multiply`, `math.divide`).
- Trigonometric functions: These include functions like sine, cosine, and tangent (`math.sin`, `math.cos`, `math.tan`).
- Exponential and logarithmic functions: These include functions like exponentiation (`math.exp`), natural logarithm (`math.log`), and logarithm with a specified base (`math.log10`, `math.log2`).
- Mathematical constants: The `math` package also provides constants such as π (`math.pi`) and Euler's number e (`math.e`).
- Other mathematical functions: The `math`
