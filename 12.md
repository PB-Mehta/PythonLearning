1. The `PdfFileReader()` and `PdfFileWriter()` File objects should be opened in the mode `'rb'` (read binary) and `'wb'` (write binary), respectively.

2. To get a `Page` object for page 5 from a `PdfFileReader` object, you can use the `getPage()` method and pass the index of the page (zero-based) as an argument. In this case, to get the `Page` object for page 5, you would use:
```
page = pdf_reader.getPage(4)
```
Note: The index is zero-based, so page 5 corresponds to index 4.

3. The number of pages in the PDF document is stored in the `numPages` variable of a `PdfFileReader` object. You can access it using `pdf_reader.numPages`.

4. If a `PdfFileReader` object's PDF is encrypted with the password "swordfish," you need to use the `decrypt()` method to decrypt it before obtaining `Page` objects. You would need to pass the correct password as an argument to the `decrypt()` method, like this:
```
pdf_reader.decrypt('swordfish')
```
After decrypting the PDF, you can access the `Page` objects.

5. To rotate a page, you can use the `rotateClockwise()` or `rotateCounterClockwise()` methods of a `Page` object. These methods allow you to specify the rotation angle in degrees, and they return a new rotated `Page` object. Here's an example:
```
rotated_page = page.rotateClockwise(90)  # Rotate the page 90 degrees clockwise
```

6. In the context of the python-docx library for working with Word documents:
- A `Run` object represents a contiguous run of text with the same formatting within a paragraph. It can have different font styles, sizes, colors, etc.
- A `Paragraph` object represents a paragraph of text in a Word document. It can contain one or more `Run` objects.

7. To obtain a list of `Paragraph` objects for a `Document` object stored in a variable named `doc`, you can access the `paragraphs` attribute of the `Document` object. It returns a list of `Paragraph` objects. Here's an example:
```
paragraphs = doc.paragraphs
```

8. The `Run` object has the `bold`, `underline`, `italic`, `strike`, and `outline` variables. These variables represent the formatting options for the text run.

9. In the context of the `bold` variable:
- `False` indicates that the text is not bold.
- `True` indicates that the text is bold.
- `None` indicates that the text's bold formatting is inherited from the surrounding context or style.

10. To create a `Document` object for a new Word document, you can use the `Document()` constructor without any arguments. Here's an example:
```
doc = Document()
```

11. To add a paragraph with the text "Hello, there!" to a `Document` object stored in a variable named `doc`, you can use the `add_paragraph()` method of the `Document` object. Here's an example:
```
doc.add_paragraph('Hello, there!')
```

12. The levels of headings available in Word documents are represented by integers ranging from 0 to 8. The integer value determines the hierarchical level of the heading, where 0 is the highest level (main heading) and 8 is the lowest level.
