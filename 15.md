1. To calculate the number of seconds in an hour, you can multiply the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (60). The result is 3600 seconds.

```python
seconds_per_hour = 60 * 60
```

2. The result of the calculation, 3600, can be assigned to a variable called `seconds_per_hour`.

3. To calculate the number of seconds in a day, you can multiply the `seconds_per_hour` variable by the number of hours in a day, which is 24. The result is 86,400 seconds.

```python
seconds_per_day = seconds_per_hour * 24
```

4. The result of the calculation, 86,400, can be saved in a variable called `seconds_per_day`.

5. To calculate the ratio of seconds per day to seconds per hour, you can divide `seconds_per_day` by `seconds_per_hour` using floating-point division (`/`).

```python
ratio = seconds_per_day / seconds_per_hour
```

The result will be a floating-point number.

6. To calculate the ratio using integer division (`//`), you can divide `seconds_per_day` by `seconds_per_hour` using integer division. This will give you the whole number part of the division.

```python
integer_ratio = seconds_per_day // seconds_per_hour
```

The result should be the same as the floating-point division, except without the decimal part.

7. Here's an example of a generator function `genPrimes` that returns the sequence of prime numbers on successive calls to its `next()` method:

```python
def genPrimes():
    primes = [2]  # Start with the first prime number, 2
    yield 2

    num = 3
    while True:
        is_prime = True
        for prime in primes:
            if num % prime == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(num)
            yield num
        num += 2  # Check only odd numbers for primality
```

You can use the generator like this:

```python
prime_generator = genPrimes()
print(next(prime_generator))  # Output: 2
print(next(prime_generator))  # Output: 3
print(next(prime_generator))  # Output: 5
# And so on...
```
