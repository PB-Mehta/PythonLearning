1. To create a list called `years_list`, starting with the year of your birth and each year thereafter until the year of your fifth birthday, you can use a list comprehension or a loop to generate the years.

Using list comprehension:
```python
birth_year = 1980  # Replace with your birth year
years_list = [birth_year + i for i in range(6)]
```

Using a loop:
```python
birth_year = 1980  # Replace with your birth year
years_list = []
for i in range(6):
    years_list.append(birth_year + i)
```

2. To determine the year in `years_list` when you had your third birthday, you can access the element at index 3 (since the first year is considered as 0).

```python
third_birthday_year = years_list[3]
```

3. To find the year in `years_list` when you were the oldest, you can simply access the last element of the list.

```python
oldest_year = years_list[-1]
```

4. To create a list called `things` with the strings "mozzarella", "cinderella", and "salmonella" as elements:

```python
things = ["mozzarella", "cinderella", "salmonella"]
```

5. To capitalize the element in `things` that refers to a person (i.e., "cinderella"), you can use the `capitalize()` method.

```python
things[1] = things[1].capitalize()
print(things)
```
Output: `['mozzarella', 'Cinderella', 'salmonella']`

Yes, it changes the element in the list.

6. To create a list called `surprise` with the elements "Groucho", "Chico", and "Harpo":

```python
surprise = ["Groucho", "Chico", "Harpo"]
```

7. To lowercase the last element of `surprise`, reverse it, and capitalize it:

```python
surprise[-1] = surprise[-1].lower()[::-1].capitalize()
print(surprise)
```
Output: `['Groucho', 'Chico', 'Oprah']`

8. To make an English-to-French dictionary called `e2f` and print it:

```python
e2f = {'dog': 'chien', 'cat': 'chat', 'walrus': 'morse'}
print(e2f)
```

9. The French word for "walrus" in the `e2f` dictionary is accessed using its key:

```python
french_word_for_walrus = e2f['walrus']
print(french_word_for_walrus)
```
Output: `'morse'`

10. To make a French-to-English dictionary called `f2e` from `e2f` using the `items()` method:

```python
f2e = {value: key for key, value in e2f.items()}
print(f2e)
```

11. To print the English version of the French word "chien" using `f2e`:

```python
english_word_for_chien = f2e['chien']
print(english_word_for_chien)
```
Output: `'dog'`

12. To create and print a set of English words from the keys in `e2f`:

```python
english_words_set = set(e2f.keys())
print(english_words_set)
```

13. To make a multilevel dictionary called `life`:

```python
life = {
    'animals': {
        'cats': ['Henri

', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy'],
        'octopi': {},
        'emus': {}
    },
    'plants': {},
    'other': {}
}
```

14. To print the top-level keys of `life`:

```python
top_level_keys = life.keys()
print(top_level_keys)
```

15. To print the keys for `life['animals']`:

```python
animals_keys = life['animals'].keys()
print(animals_keys)
```

16. To print the values for `life['animals']['cats']`:

```python
cats_values = life['animals']['cats']
print(cats_values)
```

Note: The output will be a list of strings `['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy']`.
