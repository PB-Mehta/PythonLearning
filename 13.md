1. Excel spreadsheets have several advantages over CSV spreadsheets:
   - Excel spreadsheets can contain multiple sheets within a single file, allowing for better organization and structuring of data.
   - Excel supports a wide range of formatting options such as colors, fonts, cell merging, formulas, and conditional formatting, which CSV files do not.
   - Excel spreadsheets can have complex data validation rules, data filtering, sorting, and advanced data analysis capabilities.
   - Excel supports macros and automation using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming, providing additional functionality.

2. To create reader and writer objects using the `csv` module, you pass a File object as an argument to `csv.reader()` and `csv.writer()`. The File object should be opened in the appropriate mode for reading or writing CSV data.

3. For reader objects, the File object needs to be opened in `'r'` mode (read mode). For writer objects, the File object needs to be opened in `'w'` mode (write mode).

4. The `writerow()` method is used to write a list of values as a row to a CSV file. It takes a list argument containing the values for each cell in the row and writes it to the CSV file.

5. In the context of the `csv.writer()` function:
   - The `delimiter` keyword argument specifies the character used to separate fields in the CSV file. The default delimiter is a comma (`,`), but you can specify a different character if needed.
   - The `lineterminator` keyword argument specifies the character used to terminate each line in the CSV file. The default line terminator is the newline character (`'\n'`), but you can specify a different character or sequence of characters if required.

6. The `json.loads()` function takes a string of JSON data and converts it into a Python data structure. It parses the JSON string and returns the corresponding Python objects, such as dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, booleans, and None.

7. The `json.dumps()` function takes a Python data structure, such as a dictionary or list, and converts it into a string of JSON data. It serializes the Python objects into a JSON-formatted string representation.
