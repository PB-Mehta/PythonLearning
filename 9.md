1. A relative path refers to the path of a file or directory relative to the current working directory. It does not specify the complete path from the root directory but instead provides a path relative to the current location.

2. An absolute path starts with the root directory of the operating system. In most operating systems, the root directory is represented by a forward slash (/) or a drive letter followed by a colon (C:/ for example).

3. The `os.getcwd()` function returns the current working directory, which is the directory in which the Python script is currently executing. The `os.chdir()` function is used to change the current working directory to the specified path.

4. The `.` (dot) represents the current directory, while `..` (dot-dot) represents the parent directory. They are used in file paths to navigate and reference directories relative to the current location.

5. In the path `C:\bacon\eggs\spam.txt`, the directory name (dir name) is `C:\bacon\eggs`, and the base name is `spam.txt`.

6. The three "mode" arguments that can be passed to the `open()` function are:
   - `'r'`: Read mode - opens the file for reading.
   - `'w'`: Write mode - opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.
   - `'a'`: Append mode - opens the file for appending data. New data is added to the end of the file if it already exists, and a new file is created if it doesn't.

7. If an existing file is opened in write mode (`'w'`), the contents of the file are completely overwritten. The previous content is lost, and the file is truncated to zero bytes before writing new data.

8. The `read()` method reads the entire contents of a file and returns it as a single string. It reads the file as a whole. On the other hand, the `readlines()` method reads the contents of a file line by line and returns a list of strings, where each element in the list represents a line from the file.

9. A shelf value in Python resembles a dictionary-like data structure. It is a persistent, dictionary-like object available in the `shelve` module, which allows you to store and retrieve Python objects by a key. It provides the ability to store and persistently serialize objects, similar to a database or key-value store.
