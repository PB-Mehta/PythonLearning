1. To add the current date to the text file `today.txt` as a string, you can use the following code:

```python
import datetime

current_date = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

with open('today.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write(current_date)
```

This will append the current date to the `today.txt` file.

2. To read the contents of the text file `today.txt` into the string `today_string`, you can use the following code:

```python
with open('today.txt', 'r') as file:
    today_string = file.read()
```

The contents of the file will be stored in the `today_string` variable.

3. To parse the date from the `today_string` variable, you can use the `datetime` module as follows:

```python
parsed_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(today_string, '%Y-%m-%d').date()
```

The `strptime` function is used to parse the date string using the specified format `%Y-%m-%d`. The resulting date object is stored in the `parsed_date` variable.

4. To list the files in your current directory, you can use the `os` module as follows:

```python
import os

files = os.listdir('.')
for file in files:
    print(file)
```

The `listdir` function from the `os` module is used to get a list of files in the current directory, and then each file is printed.

5. To create a list of all the files in your parent directory, you can use the `os` module and `os.path` functions as follows:

```python
import os

parent_directory = os.path.abspath('..')
files = os.listdir(parent_directory)

file_list = [os.path.join(parent_directory, file) for file in files if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(parent_directory, file))]

print(file_list)
```

This code will create a list of file paths in the parent directory by joining the parent directory path with each file name. The `os.path.isfile` function is used to filter out directories from the list.

6. Using multiprocessing to create three separate processes that wait for a random number of seconds, print the current time, and then exit can be done with the following code:

```python
import multiprocessing
import random
import time
from datetime import datetime

def process_func():
    wait_time = random.randint(1, 5)
    time.sleep(wait_time)
    current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    print(f"Process ID: {multiprocessing.current_process().pid}, Current Time: {current_time}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    processes = []
    for _ in range(3):
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_func)
        p.start()
        processes.append(p)

    for p in processes:
        p.join()
```

This code creates three separate processes using the `multiprocessing` module. Each process waits for a random number of seconds between 1 and 5 using `time.sleep()`, then prints the current time using `datetime.now()`. The processes are started, and the main process waits for all the child processes to finish using `p.join()`.

7. To create a date object of your day of birth, you can use the `datetime` module as follows:

```python
from datetime import date

birth_date = date(1990, 5, 15)  # Replace with your actual birth date
```

Replace the year, month, and day values with your actual birth date to create a `date` object representing your day of birth.

8. To determine the day

 of the week for your day of birth, you can use the `strftime` method of the `date` object to format the date as the day of the week:

```python
day_of_week = birth_date.strftime('%A')
print(day_of_week)
```

The `%A` format code is used to represent the full weekday name.

9. To calculate when you will be or when you were 10,000 days old from your day of birth, you can use the `timedelta` class from the `datetime` module as follows:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

target_date = birth_date + timedelta(days=10000)
print(target_date)
```

This code adds a `timedelta` of 10,000 days to your birth date and prints the resulting target date.
