Q1. Greedy syntax matches the longest possible string that satisfies the pattern, while non-greedy syntax matches the shortest possible string. To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one, you can introduce the "?" character after the quantifier, such as "*?" or "+?", to make it non-greedy.

Q2. The distinction between greedy and non-greedy matching is relevant when there are multiple possible matches in the input string. If you're looking for a non-greedy match but only a greedy match is available, the greedy match will be returned. In such cases, you may need to adjust the pattern or use additional techniques to achieve the desired non-greedy behavior.

Q3. In a simple match of a string without any replacement, the use of a non-tagged group (group without capturing parentheses) generally does not have a practical difference. Non-tagged groups are useful when you want to group a pattern for alternation or apply quantifiers without capturing the matched text.

Q4. A scenario where using a non-tagged category would have a significant impact is when you want to apply a quantifier to a group but do not need to capture the matched text. This can help optimize the regular expression and improve performance, especially when dealing with large input strings or complex patterns.

Q5. The non-consumptive nature of look-ahead conditions in regular expressions can make a difference in scenarios where you need to find matches based on certain conditions without including those conditions in the final match. For example, you can use look-ahead to find words followed by a specific pattern without actually including the pattern in the match result.

Q6. Positive look-ahead (x(?=y)) matches "x" only if it is followed by "y", while negative look-ahead (x(?!y)) matches "x" only if it is not followed by "y". Positive look-ahead asserts the presence of a pattern, while negative look-ahead asserts the absence of a pattern.

Q7. Referring to groups by name in a standard expression provides better readability and maintainability of the code. It makes the regular expression more self-explanatory and helps in understanding the purpose of different captured groups. Additionally, named groups allow accessing the matched text by their meaningful names, making the code more intuitive.

Q8. Yes, you can identify repeated items within a target string using named groups. For example, using the pattern `(?P<word>\w+)\s+(?P=word)`, you can match and capture repeated words in a string. The named group "word" captures the first word, and the `(?P=word)` syntax references that captured word, ensuring that the subsequent word matches the same text.

Q9. When parsing a string, the Scanner interface provides tokenization functionality, allowing you to easily extract tokens or patterns from the input string. It automatically skips over delimiters and provides methods to iterate over the tokens in a convenient manner. The `re.findall` feature, on the other hand, returns all non-overlapping matches of a pattern in a string, without the additional tokenization capabilities offered by the Scanner interface.

Q10. No, a Scanner object does not have to be named "scanner." The name of the object can be chosen freely as per the naming conventions and requirements of your program. The name "scanner" is often used as a convention to indicate an object responsible for scanning and tokenizing strings, but it is not mandatory.
