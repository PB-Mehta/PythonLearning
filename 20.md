1. To set the variable `test1` to the string `'This is a test of the emergency text system,'` and save it to a file named `test.txt`, you can use the following code:

```python
test1 = 'This is a test of the emergency text system,'

with open('test.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(test1)
```

2. To read the contents of the file `test.txt` into the variable `test2` and check if there is any difference between `test1` and `test2`, you can use the following code:

```python
with open('test.txt', 'r') as file:
    test2 = file.read()

# Compare test1 and test2
if test1 == test2:
    print("The contents of test1 and test2 are the same.")
else:
    print("There is a difference between test1 and test2.")
```

3. To create a CSV file called `books.csv` with the given lines, you can use the following code:

```python
import csv

data = [
    ['title', 'author', 'year'],
    ['The Weirdstone of Brisingamen', 'Alan Garner', '1960'],
    ['Perdido Street Station', 'China Mi√©ville', '2000'],
    ['Thud!', 'Terry Pratchett', '2005'],
    ['The Spellman Files', 'Lisa Lutz', '2007'],
    ['Small Gods', 'Terry Pratchett', '1992']
]

with open('books.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)
```

4. To use the `sqlite3` module to create a SQLite database called `books.db` and a table called `books` with the specified fields, you can use the following code:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('books.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE books (
                    title TEXT,
                    author TEXT,
                    year INTEGER
                )''')

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

5. To read the data from `books.csv` and insert it into the `books` table in the `books.db` database, you can use the following code:

```python
import csv
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('books.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

with open('books.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(reader)  # Skip the header row
    for row in reader:
        cursor.execute('INSERT INTO books VALUES (?, ?, ?)', row)

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

6. To select and print the `title` column from the `books` table in alphabetical order, you can use the following code:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('books.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

cursor.execute('SELECT title FROM books ORDER BY title')

for row in cursor:
    print(row[0])

conn.close()
```

7. To select and print all columns from the `books` table in the order of publication, you can use the following code:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('books.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM books')

for row in cursor:
    print(row)

conn.close()
```

8. To use the `sqlalchemy` module to connect to the `books.db` SQLite database, you can use the following code:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///books.db')

# Now you can use the engine to execute SQL queries and interact with

 the database
```

9. To create a Redis hash called `test` with the fields `count` (1) and `name` ('Fester Bestertester') and print all the fields, you can use the following code:

```python
import redis

# Make sure you have the Redis server running

r = redis.Redis()

r.hset('test', 'count', 1)
r.hset('test', 'name', 'Fester Bestertester')

# Print all fields in the hash
fields = r.hgetall('test')
for key, value in fields.items():
    print(key.decode(), value.decode())
```

Make sure you have installed the Redis server and the Python redis library (`pip install redis`) before running this code.

10. To increment the `count` field of the `test` hash and print its updated value, you can use the following code:

```python
# Increment the 'count' field by 1
r.hincrby('test', 'count', 1)

# Print the updated value of the 'count' field
count = r.hget('test', 'count')
print(count.decode())
```

This will increment the value of the `count` field by 1 and print the new value.
