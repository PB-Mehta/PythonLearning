Q1. To increase the comparison between different figures on the same graph, you have several choices:

- Use different colors or patterns for each figure: By assigning distinct colors or patterns to different figures, it becomes easier to differentiate them visually.
- Utilize markers or symbols: Adding markers or symbols to data points can enhance the visibility of individual data sets within the graph.
- Adjust line styles: Varying the line styles, such as using solid lines, dashed lines, or dotted lines, can aid in distinguishing different figures.
- Include a legend: Adding a legend to the graph allows you to label each figure and provide a key for interpretation.

Q2. Compound interest offers the benefit of exponential growth over time compared to a higher rate of interest that does not compound. When interest is compounded, the interest earned in each period is added to the principal, and subsequent interest is calculated based on the increased principal amount. This compounding effect leads to the growth of the investment or loan at an accelerated rate.

For example, if you invest $1,000 at a 5% annual interest rate compounded annually, your investment will grow to $1,050 after the first year. In the second year, the interest is calculated based on $1,050, leading to a higher interest amount compared to simple interest. Over time, compounding allows your investment to grow faster, accumulating more interest on top of the initial principal.

In contrast, a higher rate of interest that does not compound would result in linear growth. The interest earned would remain constant over time, leading to a slower rate of growth for the investment.

Q3. A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It consists of a series of bars, where each bar represents a specific range or bin of values, and the height of the bar indicates the frequency or count of values within that range. A histogram provides a visual depiction of the underlying distribution of the data, showing the concentration or dispersion of values.

In NumPy, you can create a histogram using the `numpy.histogram()` function. This function takes an input array of data and returns the counts or frequencies for each bin, along with the bin boundaries. The resulting histogram can be plotted using various visualization libraries, such as Matplotlib.

Q4. To change the aspect ratios between the X and Y axes, you can adjust the scaling of the plot. In Matplotlib, for example, you can use the `plt.axis('equal')` or `plt.axis('scaled')` function to set equal aspect ratios, where one unit on the X-axis is the same physical length as one unit on the Y-axis. This ensures that the scaling is the same in both directions.

Alternatively, you can manually set the aspect ratio using the `plt.gca().set_aspect()` function, specifying the desired ratio. For example, `plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')` sets an equal aspect ratio.

Q5. The three types of array multiplication between two NumPy arrays are:

- Dot product: The dot product of two arrays can be calculated using the `numpy.dot()` function or the `@` operator. It performs matrix multiplication if the arrays are 2D or higher-dimensional, or it performs element-wise multiplication followed by summing the products if the arrays are 1D.

- Outer product: The outer product of two arrays can be calculated using the `numpy.outer()` function. It returns a new array where each element is the product of all possible combinations between the elements of the input arrays.

- Regular multiplication: Regular multiplication of two arrays is performed using the `*` operator. It performs element-wise multiplication, meaning the corresponding elements of the arrays are multiplied together.

The key difference is that the dot product performs matrix multiplication or element-wise multiplication with sum

ming, while the outer product calculates all possible combinations of products between the elements. Regular multiplication, on the other hand, performs simple element-wise multiplication.

Q6. Before buying a home, you can use the `numpy.pmt()` function to calculate the monthly mortgage payment. The `numpy.pmt()` function calculates the payment for a loan based on fixed periodic payments and a fixed interest rate. It takes arguments for the interest rate, number of periods, and loan amount, among other optional parameters, and returns the monthly payment amount.

Q7. Yes, string data can be stored in NumPy arrays. However, there are some restrictions when working with string data in NumPy arrays:

- Fixed Length: NumPy arrays require a fixed length for each element. Therefore, when storing strings in a NumPy array, the array is allocated with a fixed length to accommodate the longest string in the array. This can lead to memory inefficiency if the strings have varying lengths.

- Homogeneous Data: NumPy arrays are designed to store homogeneous data, meaning all elements in the array must have the same data type. When using strings, the data type is typically `numpy.str_`, and all elements in the array should have the same string length.

- Mutable Strings: In NumPy arrays, the individual elements are immutable, including string elements. Once a string is assigned to an element in the array, it cannot be modified directly. Instead, you need to create a new string and assign it to the desired element.

Overall, while NumPy arrays can store string data, they are more commonly used for numerical computations. For more flexible handling of string data, other data structures like Python lists or pandas DataFrames are often preferred.
