1. Assign the value 7 to the variable `guess_me`. Then, write the conditional tests (if, else, and elif) to print the string 'too low' if `guess_me` is less than 7, 'too high' if greater than 7, and 'just right' if equal to 7.

```python
guess_me = 7

if guess_me < 7:
    print('too low')
elif guess_me > 7:
    print('too high')
else:
    print('just right')
```

2. Assign the value 7 to the variable `guess_me` and the value 1 to the variable `start`. Write a while loop that compares `start` with `guess_me`. Print 'too low' if `start` is less than `guess_me`. If `start` equals `guess_me`, print 'found it!' and exit the loop. If `start` is greater than `guess_me`, print 'oops' and exit the loop. Increment `start` at the end of the loop.

```python
guess_me = 7
start = 1

while True:
    if start < guess_me:
        print('too low')
    elif start == guess_me:
        print('found it!')
        break
    else:
        print('oops')
        break
    start += 1
```

3. Print the following values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0] using a for loop.

```python
my_list = [3, 2, 1, 0]

for value in my_list:
    print(value)
```

Output:
```
3
2
1
0
```

4. Use a list comprehension to make a list of the even numbers in `range(10)`.

```python
even_numbers = [num for num in range(10) if num % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)
```

Output: `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`

5. Use a dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary `squares`. Use `range(10)` to return the keys, and use the square of each key as its value.

```python
squares = {num: num**2 for num in range(10)}
print(squares)
```

Output: `{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}`

6. Construct the set `odd` from the odd numbers in the range using a set comprehension.

```python
odd = {num for num in range(10) if num % 2 != 0}
print(odd)
```

Output: `{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}`

7. Use a generator comprehension to return the string 'Got ' and a number for the numbers in `range(10)`. Iterate through this by using a for loop.

```python
generator = ('Got ' + str(num) for num in range(10))

for item in generator:
    print(item)
```

Output:
```
Got 0
Got 1
Got 2
Got 3
Got 4
Got 5
Got 6
Got 7
Got 8
Got 9
```

8. Define a function called `good` that returns the list `['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']`.

```python
def good():
    return ['Harry', 'Ron', 'H

ermione']

result = good()
print(result)
```

Output: `['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']`

9. Define a generator function called `get_odds` that returns the odd numbers from `range(10)`. Use a for loop to find and print the third value returned.

```python
def get_odds():
    for num in range(10):
        if num % 2 != 0:
            yield num

# Using a for loop to find and print the third value
count = 1
for value in get_odds():
    if count == 3:
        print(value)
        break
    count += 1
```

Output: `5`

10. Define an exception called `OopsException`. Raise this exception to see what happens. Then write the code to catch this exception and print 'Caught an oops'.

```python
class OopsException(Exception):
    pass

try:
    raise OopsException
except OopsException:
    print('Caught an oops')
```

Output: `Caught an oops`

11. Use `zip()` to make a dictionary called `movies` that pairs these lists: `titles = ['Creature of Habit', 'Crewel Fate']` and `plots = ['A nun turns into a monster', 'A haunted yarn shop']`.

```python
titles = ['Creature of Habit', 'Crewel Fate']
plots = ['A nun turns into a monster', 'A haunted yarn shop']

movies = dict(zip(titles, plots))
print(movies)
```

Output: `{'Creature of Habit': 'A nun turns into a monster', 'Crewel Fate': 'A haunted yarn shop'}`
