1. RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is a color model that represents colors using a combination of red, green, and blue channels, along with an alpha channel for transparency.

2. To get the RGBA value of an image using the Pillow module, you can use the `im.getpixel()` method. For example, if `im` is an Image object, you can get the RGBA value of a specific pixel at coordinates (x, y) using `im.getpixel((x, y))`.

3. A box tuple in Pillow represents a rectangular region in an image. It is defined as a tuple of four values: (left, upper, right, lower). The `left` and `upper` values specify the coordinates of the top-left corner of the box, while the `right` and `lower` values specify the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the box.

4. To find out the width and height of an Image object, you can use the `im.size` attribute. For example, if `im` is an Image object, you can access its width and height using `im.size[0]` and `im.size[1]` respectively.

5. To get an Image object for a 100Ã—100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it, you can use the `im.crop()` method. You would define the box tuple to specify the region you want to crop, and then call `im.crop(box)` to obtain the cropped Image object.

6. After making changes to an Image object, you can save it as an image file using the `im.save()` method. You need to provide the filename and the desired file format as arguments. For example, `im.save("output.jpg", "JPEG")` will save the image as a JPEG file named "output.jpg".

7. The module that contains Pillow's shape-drawing code is `PIL.ImageDraw`. It provides functions and methods for drawing various shapes, such as lines, rectangles, circles, polygons, and text, on Image objects.

8. Image objects do not have drawing methods themselves. Instead, you need to create an ImageDraw object from the Image object to perform drawing operations. You can create an ImageDraw object using the `ImageDraw.Draw()` function, passing the Image object as an argument. For example, `draw = ImageDraw.Draw(im)` creates an ImageDraw object named `draw` from the Image object `im`, which can then be used to draw shapes on the image.
