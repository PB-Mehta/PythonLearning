1. An empty dictionary's code is simply `{}`. It represents an empty collection of key-value pairs.

2. The value of a dictionary value with the key `'foo'` and the value `42` would be `42`. In other words, accessing `spam['foo']` would return `42`.

3. The most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list is their structure and usage:
- Dictionary: A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique within the dictionary, and it is used to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified. They are commonly used for mapping and associating data.
- List: A list is an ordered collection of elements. The elements in a list are indexed by integers, starting from 0. Lists are mutable and can contain duplicate values. They are used to store an ordered sequence of items.

4. If you try to access `spam['foo']` when `spam` is `{ 'bar': 100 }`, it will raise a `KeyError`. This error occurs because the key `'foo'` does not exist in the dictionary `spam`.

5. If a dictionary is stored in `spam`, the expression `'cat' in spam` checks if the key `'cat'` exists in the dictionary. It returns `True` if the key is present and `False` otherwise. On the other hand, the expression `'cat' in spam.keys()` also checks if the key `'cat'` exists in the dictionary, but it specifically looks for the key within the keys of the dictionary. The result would be the same, but it explicitly specifies that the search is performed on the keys.

6. If a dictionary is stored in `spam`, the expression `'cat' in spam` checks if the key `'cat'` exists in the dictionary. It returns `True` if the key is present and `False` otherwise. In contrast, the expression `'cat' in spam.values()` checks if the value `'cat'` exists in the dictionary. It returns `True` if any value in the dictionary is equal to `'cat'` and `False` otherwise.

7. A shortcut for the given code is to use the `setdefault()` method:
```python
spam.setdefault('color', 'black')
```
This method checks if the key `'color'` exists in the `spam` dictionary. If it does, it returns the corresponding value. If it doesn't, it adds the key `'color'` with the default value `'black'` to the dictionary.

8. To "pretty print" dictionary values, you can use the `pprint` module's `pprint()` function. This function displays the dictionary in a more readable and formatted way, especially when dealing with nested dictionaries or complex data structures. The code would look like this:
```python
import pprint

pprint.pprint(dictionary)
```
Replace `dictionary` with the actual dictionary variable you want to pretty print.
