Q1. Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming languages that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. With multiple inheritance, a class can derive characteristics and behaviors from more than one parent class. This means that the subclass will have access to the attributes and methods of all its parent classes, allowing for greater flexibility in code organization and reusability.

Q2. Delegation is a design pattern in which an object passes on a method call to another object to perform the desired action. Instead of implementing the behavior directly, the delegating object forwards the request to another object, known as the delegate, which handles the request and returns the result. Delegation allows for code reuse, separation of concerns, and the ability to dynamically change behavior at runtime by swapping out the delegate object.

Q3. Composition is a design principle in object-oriented programming that involves building complex objects by combining simpler objects or components. In composition, an object is composed of one or more other objects, known as components or parts, and the composite object delegates certain responsibilities to its components. This allows for creating complex structures and behaviors by assembling and arranging simpler objects.

Q4. Bound methods are methods that are associated with a specific instance of a class. When a method is called on an instance, the instance itself is automatically passed as the first argument to the method, typically referred to as `self`. This binding of the method to the instance allows the method to access and operate on the instance's attributes and state. Bound methods are commonly used to manipulate and interact with the specific instance they are bound to.

Q5. Pseudoprivate attributes, also known as name mangling, are a way to create attributes in a class that are intended to be "private" or inaccessible from outside the class. In Python, attributes that are prefixed with double underscores (`__`) but not suffixed with another underscore are automatically "mangled" by the interpreter. This means that their names are modified to include the class name, which helps to avoid accidental attribute name conflicts between classes. Pseudoprivate attributes provide a way to indicate that certain attributes are intended to be internal to the class and should not be accessed or modified directly from outside the class. However, it's important to note that Python does not enforce true data encapsulation, and pseudoprivate attributes can still be accessed and modified if their mangled names are known.
